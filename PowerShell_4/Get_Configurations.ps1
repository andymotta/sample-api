# Example Powershell script for GETting your list of Environments from the Skytap API.
# NOTE: Throughout the Skytap API, environments are referred to as "configurations." Skytap no longer uses the term 
#        "configurations" in the web interface; however, it has been maintained in the API for backwards-compatibility.
# Requires PowerShell 4.0 or greater.  Powershell 3.0 and early had a bug and would not permit Accept Headers
#>

# Use TLS 1.2 rather than PowerShell default of 1.0
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

#Skytap credentials 
$username = <your_skytap_login_id>
$password = <your_login_or_API_Token>

#convert username:password for basic Authentication with Skytap API
$base64AuthInfo = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(("{0}:{1}" -f $username,$password)))

#Base URI for the Skytap resource you are accessing.  In this example, the Environments (aka Configurations) resource.
$uri = "https://cloud.skytap.com/configurations"

#set requisite headers for Skytap API (JSON preferred, could use xml as well)
$headers = @{"Accept" = "application/json"; Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $base64AuthInfo)}

#put it all together to GET your list of Skytap Environments (aka Configurations)
